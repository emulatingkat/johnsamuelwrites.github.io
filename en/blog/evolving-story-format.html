        <p>Some stories evolve and do not usually end with 'And they lived happily ever after'.
           Real life is much more challenging, new twists come now and then, like in a play, when we are expecting nothing of a big drama, new characters enter the scene and leave most of us wondering what next. 
           Some writers abruptly end their stories, leaving their readers to imagine the rest.
           While others write many novels, still leaving the doors open for future writers.
           Not a single domain has remained stagnant all these years.
           When almost everybody thought that there will not be any novelty coming up in a particular domain, all of a sudden, someone somewhere comes up with a new hypothesis and the domain is back in picture.
           Therefore no domain can just be confined to a few books. 
        </p>
        <p>The shift from paper notebooks and books to internet</p>
        <p>Long story format (add to top or bottom of page)</p>
        <p>evolving story (updates anywhere) tracked by version control</p>
        <p>changing facts thanks to new research works </p>
        <p>motivation: similar to writing an article on a piece of paper. once draft version is completed, reread, corrections, grammatical errors, rephrasing. From paper to version control (simulating this experience)</p>
        <p>story of the making of the article</p>
        <p>just like our ideas and opinions evolve, based on new information and when our old assumptions are no longer true, there are advancements on a single topic based on new scientific discoveries and facts.</p>
        <p>two possible options: writing a new blog post or update the older one</p>
        <p>writing a new blog post based on the update is a time-chronicled way</p>
        <p>updation especially with the help of version control (or creating separate sections based on the change)</p>
        <p>what else evolves? not just textual content, styles, fonts, colors, background</p>
        <p>new images, change in titles, addition/modification of sections, new articles</p>
        <p>images, use of SVG diagrams, SVG (XML), hence textual and easier to track the changes</p>
        <p>who else follows the approach? wikipedia, collaborative knowledge repository or encyclopedia, one can check the older versions of the article? collaborative and consensus of the associated authors/editors on the topic</p>
        <p>wikipedia entries tells the story of a collaboration </p>
        <p>difference (with wikipedia): collaborative (involving multiple persons) versus personal (involving just the author, personal reading list, personal understanding, learning process, recalling process, collecting and refining the thoughts on various topics)</p>
        <p>one page for each topic of interest</p>
        <p>similarly personal blogs tracked by version control tell a story of an individual and the progress and the evolution of his ideas and opinions based on new facts</p>
        <p>I frequently <b>commit</b> my changes.
          Frequent commiting with good commit notes is an interesting way to understand my own thought process at different instants of time.
          They also serve as the evidence of the evolution of my thoughts on a given topic.
          The major advantage is that I am able to write more frequently and at the same time improve my writing style.</p>
