           Some stories evolve and do not usually end with 'And they lived happily ever after'.
           Real life is much more challenging, new twists come now and then, like in plays, where when we are expecting nothing of a big surprise, new characters enter the scene and leave most of us wondering what's next. 
           Some writers abruptly end their stories, leaving their readers to imagine the rest.
           While others write many novels, still leaving the doors open for future writers.
           Here, I would like to describe what I call <b>evolving story format</b> to explore continuous writing on any subject: writing, updating and keeping track of the evolution.

           Not a single domain has remained stagnant all these years.
           When almost everybody thought that there will not be any novelty coming up in the particular domain, all of a sudden, someone somewhere comes up with a new hypothesis and the domain is back in picture.
           No domain can just be confined to a few books. 
        </p>
        <p>Last several years have seen the shift from paper notebooks and books to internet.
           It is important to note that physical books have not lost their charm.
           But internet has provided a new medium for dissemination of information in novel ways.
           In the beginning, we saw an internet equivalent of everything we know as physical in the virtual world and we continue to use the same terminonlogy of the physical world to refer to items on the internet.
           We now have (virtual) articles, newspapers, journals, books on the internet and are very much successful in mimicking their physical world counterparts.
           But physical world objects have their limitations: once an author has published a book and expressed opinions based on the facts known at the time of writing or publishing, it is difficult to change based on new known facts.
           We have seen corrigendum, erratum in newspaper articles.
           Here I would like to pose the question: virtual publishing has a lot more possibilities compared to physical world publishing, but do we need to limit ourselves by mimicking everything exactly according to the physical world equivalent?

          A traditional approach in publishing on the internet is to write a blog article and publish at a given date. 
          Any new development to the story already published requires writing a blog article and add hyperlinks to the previous article to give the readers the context.
          Though linking articles helps the user to find the previous article easily (compare it to the case where the reader has to check a newspaper of some days ago), it still requires the reader to refer to multiple articles 
          Long story format<sup><a href="#longform">1</a></sup> enabadd to top or bottom of page) 
           Is top of the page better? readers do not need to scroll down to the end of the page to get the latest update. But what about the first time reader?
           Is chronological presentation a good option, letting the readers follow the course starting from the beginning to the latest?
           What if some older sections need to be written? 
        </p>
        <p>evolving story (updates anywhere) tracked by version control</p>
        <p>changing facts thanks to new research works </p>
        <p>motivation: similar to writing an article on a piece of paper. once draft version is completed, reread, corrections, grammatical errors, typos, rephrasing. From paper to version control (simulating this experience)</p>
        <p>story of the making of the article</p>
        <p>just like our ideas and opinions evolve, based on new information and when our old assumptions are no longer true, there are advancements on a single topic based on new scientific discoveries and facts.</p>
        <p>two possible options: writing a new blog post or update the older one</p>
        <p>writing a new blog post based on the update is a time-chronicled way</p>
        <p>updation especially with the help of version control (or creating separate sections based on the change)</p>
        <p>what else evolves? not just textual content, styles, fonts, colors, background</p>
        <p>new images, change in titles, addition/modification of sections, new articles</p>
        <p>images, use of SVG diagrams, SVG (XML), hence textual and easier to track the changes</p>
        <p>who else follows the approach? wikipedia, collaborative knowledge repository or encyclopedia, one can check the older versions of the article? collaborative and consensus of the associated authors/editors on the topic</p>
        <p>wikipedia entries tells the story of a collaboration </p>
        <p>difference (with wikipedia): collaborative (involving multiple persons) versus personal (involving just the author, personal reading list, personal understanding, learning process, recalling process, collecting and refining the thoughts on various topics)</p>
        <p>one page for each topic of interest</p>
        <p>similarly personal blogs tracked by version control tell a story of an individual and the progress and the evolution of his ideas and opinions based on new facts</p>
        <p>I frequently <b>commit</b> my changes.
          Frequent commiting with good commit notes is an interesting way to understand my own thought process at different instants of time.
          They also serve as the evidence of the evolution of my thoughts on a given topic.
          The major advantage is that I am able to write more frequently and at the same time improve my writing style.</p>
