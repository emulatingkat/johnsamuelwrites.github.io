        <p>I <b>love to write</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I usually jot down my thoughts while traveling and reading books.
          But usually, weekends and late evenings are the time when I take up writing seriously.
          Late evenings during the week, I write down small phrases and during the weekend, I try to complete the posts.
          Since I follow long story format, I keep on adding new thoughts over a topic and quite often deleting or altering certain ideas.
          But every addition or removal is monitored by the version control software.
          This gives me a vague picture of the evolution of my thoughts from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>Earlier, I used my notebooks and computer to jot down my thoughts.
          The result of which is that I have an accumulation of notes and ideas unwritten anywhere on the internet.
          Now every new idea or thought results in a small update on the webpage of the corresponding topic or the emergence of a new article.
        </p>
        <p>The advantages of having incomplete posts on the internet are many.
          Though they may seem incomplete in the sense that they are missing complete sentences, but they do contain the crux of the article.
          Incomplete posts motivate me to focus and work on the articles as early as possible, especially during the weekends.
          They are easily accessible anywhere, anytime unlike my notebooks.
          Also they are much easier for me to analyse and elaborate than writing complete sentences every time.
        </p>
        <p>I also frequently <b>commit</b> my changes.
          I often pose this question to myself: is frequent commiting really a good idea?
          But whenever I check my commit history, I totally am for the idea of frequent commiting.
          Frequent commiting with good commit notes is an interesting way to understand my own thought process at different instants of time.
          They are the evidence of the evolution of my thoughts on a given topic.
        </p>
        <p>The result of this way of writing phrases and short sentences during the weekdays and completing them during the weekends is that I am able to write more frequently and at the same time improve my writing style.</p>
