        <p>I started photography some years back.
           The prime inspiration came from my father's analog photography, though most of his photographs revolved around family and friends.
           But he had stopped photography a long back.
           And all I know is that his camera no longer worked.
           Though this apparently inutile device left a lasting mark in my mind.
           And as soon as I could afford a mobile phone with a camera, I purchased one with quite humble camera features.
           Here again, I followed my father's footsteps.
           Most of my initial photographs revolved around my friends and family.
           Slowly I started travelling, making smaller trips to nearby towns and cities.
           I required a better apparatus to record my travelogues.
           Again, I purchased a smartphone with much better camera settings.
           Slowly, my pictures concentrated more on the objects around me than on myself: the trees, the roads, the monuments.
        </p>
        <p>Then came the big change in my life: from traveling to cities to traveling to different countries.
           I required a better camera and I finally bought a better camera, this time an appartus targeted just for one and only thing: photography.
           Digital camera became part of my life.
           I could zoom without having a loss in the quality of my photographs.
           I started with automatic mode and practised with it for a very long time. 
           Slowly I started reading blogs on photography and checking the works of other photographs.
           I learned about ISO settings and adjusting the focal length.
           It took me a significantly long time to be at ease with these settings.
           My initial photographs were based on my first impressions on arriving at a spot.
           I took a lot of photographs.
           Slowly I reduced the number of photographs by first looking around the spot to find a location from where I could get a better perspective.
           Now when I look back, I feel a glimpse of my experiments, my learning progress.
           I do not consider myself a professional photographer at all.
           I have still got a lot to learn and still feel that most of my photographs and based on my first few moments of impression.
           Nevertheless I do want to share some of my amateur experiments.</p>

        <p>use of filters?</p>
        <p>flash?</p>
        <p>raw pictures or jpeg format? size? experiments?</p>
        <h3>Processing</h3>
        <p>Watermark or not?</p>
        <p>Some reworking</p>

        <p>git performance considerations? 1 gb</p>
        <p>megabytes-sized photographs compared to kilobytes sized svg diagrams?</p>
        <p>open question: current image formats to svg?</p>
        <p>existing tools (based on edge detection research) like potrace?</p>
        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>An ongoing learning: lessons from friends, professionals and
diverse photography blogs</p>
        <p>reference straight lines, horizon, vanishing point</p>
        <p>lots of experimentation</p>
        <p>A long way to go</p>
