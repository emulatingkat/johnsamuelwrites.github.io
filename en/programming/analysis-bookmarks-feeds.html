        <p>I susbscribe to a number of feeds from various open-source and technology based blogs.
          On one hand, it helps me to be up-to date with latest technological developments, but on the other hand, I waste time skipping through a lot of irrelevant articles.
          Many of the current desktop feed aggregators don't have any option that could help me to filter the articles based on the analysis of the articles that I read in the past or those that I tagged as important.
          So what I am looking for is a tool that can help me to analyse my <b>bookmarked and tagged articles</b> to help me <b>filter relevant articles from my subscribed feeds</b>.
        </<p>
        <p>Thus there are two data sources: <b>bookmarks from internet browsers</b> and <b>feed aggregators</b>.
          Both of them use HTML, XML or JSON as data format to store bookmarks or feeds.
          But the next question that arises is whether the data format is <b>standardized</b> across browsers and feed aggregators.
          Feed aggregators usually support importing or exporting files of subscriptions in OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language)<a href="#opml"><sup>1</sup></a> format.
          Browsers let you export or import bookmarks in HTML format.
          In some cases like Firefox, user tags are not present in the exported HTML file.
          One option here, in case of Firefox is to make use of bookmark backups that provide a lot of information not usually present in the exported files like the logo URL of the bookmarked sites, time of bookmarking, user-generated tags.
        </p>
        <p>So the next obvious question that arises: what are the <b>data available for performing analysis</b>?
          Following is a list of data available from the exported bookmark HTML, bookmark backup JSON files and subscribed feeds OPML file:
          <ul>
            <li>Source URL
              <ul>
                <li>Article title</li>
                <li>Article content (usually for feeds, after fetching the content)</li>
                <li>Website URL</li>
                <li>Website title</li>
                <li>Website description (often available)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
           <li>Timestamp
             <ul>
               <li>Bookmarked time</li>
               <li>Time of last modification</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>User-generated content
            <ul>
              <li>Categories/Folders</li>
              <li>Tags</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          This is a treasure-trove of information.
          Take for example, given the availability of time, one interesting aspect is to know what theme of topics interested me during specific periods of time.
          Tags and categories (or folders) may also give an idea of the way of my information classification style.
        </p>
        <p>What better way to analyse than to <b>visualize</b>?
          There are a large number of visualization libraries available that can help me to obtain a word cloud corresponding to my bookmarked articles, especially to understand what topic interests me the most.
          Then there are libraries that can help me to visualize my interests at different points of time.
          Which website do I use quite regularly?
        </p>
        <p>
          The overall goal is not only to understand my reading behaviour but also to save my time skipping through irrelevant or redundant articles.
          Therefore it is very important to cluster the articles based on theme and grouping similar articles.
          Another important aspect is that the aspect of surprise or new technological advances should not be missing from the overall scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Information overload</b> is a major challenge, but there are several ways to reduce it.
