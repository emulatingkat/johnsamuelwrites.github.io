        <p>I am building this site to discuss about my work, my research and some personal experiences.
I am using version control for building this site since it gives me the ability to track the progress and also get a glance of my past thought process.
       </p>
        <p>
Currently the whole site is built only using HTML and CSS.
I am not using any blogging platform like Jekyll.
The site is aimed to have a responsive and minimalistic design, multilingual, human and machine-readable content.
I discuss below in detail various considerations for building this site.
Some of these may seem fantasy, but these are the factors that motivates me.
       </p>
        <p>
          <b>No Blogging platforms</b> will be used.
I believe that behind every blog post, there is a story to tell.
Dependence on any particular blogging platform takes away this per-post flexibility.
Many actual blogging platforms support global site themes and ignore themes for individual posts. 
Depending only on HTML and CSS for creating a static web page enables me to create individual stories.
The question of site-wide uniform experience still concerns me, but based on my personal experiences, I feel that it is quite rare that we read more than one article from a single site. 
In most of the cases, we are directed to a web page from a search engine.
And once we have read what we were looking for, we either switch to another web page or go back to the search engine. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Every web page must be <b>Lightweight</b>.
No heavy-weight javascript frameworks will be used for writing the blog posts.
Research shows that the average size of the web page has been tremendously increasing for the last few years.
Also I want to write both javascript and CSS on the same web page, i.e., not separate HTTP calls for fetching the CSS fand javascript files.
        </p>
        <p>
There is no doubt that given the wide variety of devices that we are currently using, <b>Responsive</b> web page design is the need of the hour. 
        </p>
        <p>
I also wish to experiment a <b>Minimalistic</b> approach, by providing the readers a distraction-free reading and also decreasing the dependence on a large number of Javascript frameworks to enable me to focus on the writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also I want to experiment <b>Multilingual</b> posts. Should I envision automated translation or a semi-automated approach? 
        </p>
        <p>
How far can I try to make my page <b>Machine Readable</b> is still an open question?
I want to explore first machine readable web page metadata and slowly move towards the content of the web pages.
It looks like semantic web technologies needs to be put in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
There are many authors stressing on the need for <b>Long Story or Detailed and Elaborative Posts</b>.
Personally, I too share the same opinion.
One single post on a topic and updates based on new developments related to the topic.
        </p>
        <p>
Time has proven that <b>Version Control</b> is not just for programming, but for all our content.
Version controlling my blog posts also helps me to get a glance on the way of my working.
Every sentence that I add, update or delete gives me an idea about the progress of my thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
Finally, <b>No Analytics</b> or tracking will be used on any web page. 
This is a very ancient dilemma for any author. 
Should an author write for the audience or for oneself.
After giving a lot of thought on this matter, I feel that I prefer the latter and hence the reason behind no per-page analytics.
