        <p>Some ongoing works
        <ol>
          <li>Propositions
            <ul>
             <li><a href="next-gen-citation.html">Photographs and Videos: Next-Generation Citation sources?</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><a href="art.html">Art</a> is an ongoing project to draw and model various objects and concepts using open standards and open-source softwares. Some objectives including tracing the learning progress, analyzing the results as well as discovering the emerging story in the process.</li>
          <li><a href="data-science.html">Data Science</a> is a collection of notes concerning data science research. They include both answered as well as unanswered questions that many posed and still continue posing.</li>
          <li><a href="../programming/index.html">Programming</a></li>
          <li><a href="../technology/index.html">Technology</a></li>
          <li><a href="behind-the-curtains.html">Behind the Curtains</a> or backstage is the place where multitude of actual practices occur before the final rehearsal and play. Various options are explored and decisions are made accordingly. Thus behind every story, there is a story. Behind every software application, there is an undiscovered and unexplored story of oft-forgotten human contributions.</li>
          <li><a href="services.html">Services</a> have been around for a while. There are several different ways they have been offered over the internet- through internet browsers for manual use and through API (application programming interface) for (semi-)automated use by machines. This project explores various available options.</li>
          <li><a href="application-development.html">Application Development</a> involves understanding the software requirements and target platforms. On analysing various software applications, a generic profile of software requirements emerges. Each target platform has diverse set of libraries for various functionalities. Building a generic application, one that targets all the platforms is daunting as well as challenging. Some of these generic requirements and development challenges have been discussed here.</li>
          <li><a href="knowledge-representation.html">Knowledge Representation</a> techniques are not just confined for the purpose of reasoning. Increasingly they are becoming part of the software applications for diverse reasons like information discovery and retrieval. Some knowledge representation techniques and associated usages are documented here.</li>
          <li><a href="operating-systems.html">Operating Systems</a> landscape has changed a lot during the last few years. Hypervisors and container technologies are being used in production. Several concepts like unikernels, rump kernels are now being discussed about. These are some of the notes related to various OS trends.</li>
          <li><a href="algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> serve their purposes for achieving desired results. Some of them perform well under conditions while others do not. It is sometimes difficult to make a choice between a deluge of algorithms and their associated data structures. Documented here is a very small subset of the algorithmic landscape.</li>
          <li>If <a href="universe.html">Universe</a> were a computer simulation, then the various laws governing the universe can be (possibly) simulated. For example, the beautiful planetary motion described by Kepler's laws can be easily simulated. Similarly flowers, trees, mountains are being modeled and rendered for realistic visual experience in computer games and movies. A fraction of these objects and their modeling are being explored.</li>
