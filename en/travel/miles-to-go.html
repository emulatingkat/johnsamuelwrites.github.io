        <p>During the final year of my high school, I came across the poem 'Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening' by Robert Frost where the poet concludes with his desire to go on with his travel despite the beautiful view of snowfall in the woods.
           The words from this poem rhyme in my ears everytime I hear the word 'travel', motivating me to go on newer adventures.
           And whenever I start on a journey to a new destination, my excitement knows no bounds, the deep desire to discover something new, something different each time.
           Several years have passed since I started my first travel without my family.
           I have travelled both alone and along with my friends, both of which has a different experience to tell.
           Travelling alone gives you the total liberty to get lost in some streets, make the same street again and again as well as visit whatever place you want.
           Though it may seem adventurous, it may turn boring, especially because you don't have someone to share your experiences. 
           On the other hand, travelling in a group, especially with friends is fun.
           Nevertheless it requires a lot of planning especially you need to keep into account of preferences of everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
           My travel escapades took me to different types of villages, towns and cities, from historical ones to the newly built, from highly populated to 
           I do not prefer crowded cities especially when you can discover a lot in smaller towns and cities.
           Cities all around the world seem to me more or less the same, with their cuboidal concrete blocks.
           I am sure that I share this same sentiment with many people around the world.
           Cities are becoming increasingly homogenized.
           You can find the same marks and brands everywhere.
           It's becoming less common to find something that's unique to one particular city.
        </p>
        <p>History attracts me a lot.
           Most of the times, I find myself standing in the ancient ruins, trying to listen the story that they wish to tell me.
           Those broken walls and ceilings, those shattered stones narrate a lot of stories to the visitors.
           The serenity of empty historical monuments in far away towns and villages transcends oneself to some unknown past.</p>
        <p>
           In some of these historical places, we come across the cobbled stones.
           Walking over them 
        </p>
        <p>Reliving the past</p>
        <p>Costumes, costumes worn by the people during different periods in history, old photographs,
           which we may now call fashion trends</p>
        <p>museums, human artefacts, broken pots, ruins</p>
        <p>nature, valleys, mountains, peaks, ridges, waterfall, water bodies, seas, deserts</p>
        <p>occassional trekking</p>
        <p>Food, mother 'I don't worry about you because you can easily adjust with the food'. cheese, wine</p>
        <p>Walking and Losing the way</p>
        <p>Street Art</p>
        <p>Homogeneous buildings: those cuboidal structures</p>
        <p>Diversity: linguistic diversity during several train trips</p>
        <p>Love to wish and thank people in their native language</p>
