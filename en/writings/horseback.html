        <p>The tryst was changed for the second time.<br>
           My brain muttered,<br>
           You will miss it again.<br>
           You said that you will come.<br>
           My heart told me to believe,<br>
           And to wait for you.<br>
           But you didn't come riding on a horseback.<p>
        <p>You were late for the tryst,<br>
           My cruel brain mocked me.<br>
           My heart rebuked it to stop this scorn,<br>
           And let it cherish those moments.<br>
           Those valuable moments of waiting,<br>
           Before the destined hour of meet.<br>
           But you didn't come riding on a horseback.<p>
        <p>At this hour, no cathedral bells rang.<br>
           No lightning flashed in the sky.<br>
           No cool breeze was flowing.<br>
           The sun was getting ready to sleep.<br>
           And here am I, waiting alone.<br>
           Waiting all alone, for you to come.<br>
           But you didn't come riding on a horseback.</p>
        <p>I looked for you, for your signs,<br>
           In all four directions of the carrefour.<br>
           And then you came, walking towards me.<br>
           Is that really you?<br>
           The person whose image I saw,<br>
           But on a virtual screen.<br>
           Yes, you came, you finally came.<br>
           But you didn't come riding on a horseback.</p>
        <p>But why was I expecting a horse?<br>
           Was my vision so blurred,<br>
           Because of all those books I read?<br>
           Were my aspirations too high?<br>
           When what should matter is that you came.<br>
           Yes, you came and you came with a dog.<br>
           But you didn't come riding on a horseback.</p>
        <p>Your dog was dragging you.<br>
           I was a bit scared.<br>
           And I asked myself,<br>
           Who wants to see me more?<br>
           You or your dog.<br>
           As for me, I want to embrace you more.<br>
           But you didn't come riding on a horseback.</p>
