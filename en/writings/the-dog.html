        <p>The winter days are not yet over.
           The sun is out.
           And so are the people on the banks of the river Rhone.
           In the winters, one need not look at the sky to check whether the weather outside is good, but just need to look at the number of people walking on the banks.
           When in cold winter days, these banks are totally deserted whereas during sunny winter days, they are overcrowded.
           One might even wonder where all these people are coming from.</p>
        <p>
           I also left my apartment to make the most of the heat of the sun.
           But I did not forget to put on my headphones with some old music.
           There were less number of people than I expected.
           It was evident.
           There were some clouds in the sky and cool breeze was blowing.
           Even though, I was fully dressed from head to bottom, I was feeling the cold breeze on my face.
           But I continued walking.
           It's quite a long time that I didn't go out for a long walk.
        </p>
        <p>weekend, sunny, but bit cold</p>
        <p>started walking outside, along the banks of the river</p>
        <p>with headphones</p>
        <p>many people on the bank for a walk, some with their dogs, some jogging</p>
        <p>swans, barge</p>
        <p>people having a drink</p>
        <p>while coming back, a musician with trombone</p>
        <p>woman with her dog, coming from the other direction</p>
        <p>musician started playing, dog stopped, stared at the slide or stopped for the music</p>
        <p>I took off my headphones wondering what was happening. But I kept on walking.</p>
        <p>I walked forward, crossing the musician. I turned back.
           I looked at the dog, dog kept on staring at the musician and the instrument.
           His owner was dragging him. 
           But the dog didn't budge. 
           I put on back my headphones and walked back home, still thinking about the dog.</p>
